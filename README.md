#  NHS Referral to Treatment (RTT) Waiting Time Analysis  
*Data cleaning, exploration, and visualization using Python*

## Project Overview

This project analyzes NHS Referral to Treatment (RTT) waiting-time data to understand patient delays, identify long-wait patterns, and highlight hospitals or specialities with the highest backlog.

The analysis supports data-driven decision making for:

- Capacity planning  
- Reducing waiting list pressures  
- Improving patient experience  
- Monitoring 52-week+ long waits  

## Key Objectives

- Clean and preprocess raw NHS RTT datasets  
- Identify long-wait patients (including 52-week waiters)  
- Compare waiting times across treatment functions and NHS providers  
- Create summary statistics and visual insights  
- Build reproducible Python scripts and notebooks
